# [Pâte folle](https://patefolle.vercel.app/)

## Setup your own baking recipe and countdown.

### What can I do exactly?

- [x] Your own proportions between water, dough and leavin. You can setting it up with some sliders. I'am based on baking mathematics rules.
- [x] A timer schedule, split between diferent steps you need for making a bread.
- [x] A countdown. You need to accept the notifications in your browser for getting it. You can (theorically...) close your browser and reopen it, it will continue automatically, based on the current running time.
- [x] You can save your recipe. It's stock in session storage.
- [x] You can share it, all data are available into the url.
